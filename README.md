# imp_predict
Impression prediction scripts for model version 1.0

# Training details for Generation 1.0
- The Generation 1.0 code is based on an FCHL representation/kernel, this is a modified Kernel Ridge Regression algorithm
- The Gen1.0 model is trained on Dataset 4: 772 small molecules from the CSD, with optimised structures and NMR parameters
calculated with DFT (add dft details, or link to paper)
- Validation was done on 442 random molecules again from the CSD (add details)

# Performance metrics
- add performance of model
